# java-multithreading-img-resizer
**how it works**:
- you need to add some image files in source folder "imgSrc", 
- set image width you need in main class, example:    
      //set new width for resizing images
       static int newWidth = 300;
- start main();
- finally u got resized copies of source images in src folder "imgDst"
